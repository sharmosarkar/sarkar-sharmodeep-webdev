        I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from Northeastern University and hold a Bachelor's degree (BEngg) in computer science from B V Bhoomaraddi Hubli, Karnataka, India.
        <br>
        My Primary interests are in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing and this is my very first attempt to full-stack development.
